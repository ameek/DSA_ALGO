# creating a linked list from scratch using python
# what is a linked list?
# A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
# The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers
# A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list.
# A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list.
# The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail.
# The tail points to None, which indicates the end of the list.
